                    <p>
                    I am currently an ungraduate student majoring in computer science at the City College of New York. I am in my senior year and am expected to graduate Fall 2021. I am also interning
                    at the Department of Education on the Cyber Security Team. I am looking in to getting more experience in the software engineering field and the Cyber Security field to decide which
                    one is right for me.

                    <h4>Back End Development</h4>
                    <p>
                    Back end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works
                    I have devloped multiple projects as a back end developer. Most times I have been responsible for architecting the entire system of how the back end server communicates with the
                    database and the front end. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Front End Development</h4>
                    <p>
                    Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website.
                    Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. I am 
                    familiar with multiple Front End framworks such as angular, react, ionic and PHP
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cloud Deployment</h4>
                    <p>
                    Cloud Deployment is making your website/application public.
                    I can make that happen while making the site more secure and reliable. 
                    Leveraging CI/CD tools we can also streamline development of the project and 
                    have deployed in a single pipeline.
